       last log in summer of second year of medician school, i guess i'm ok with what
       i did so far in this book, just gonna print the rest of it and bookbind it. I don't
       know if i'm really done with it or i'm no longer interested. cuz i want to read/write
       code in real software programs
     - =2019-08-27=

       Update this, now I finished almost 60% of this book, and I'm going to scape some of the 
       chapter 4, so may jump directly to /4.4 logic programming/. which mean I done almost +70% of the book
     - =2019-04-13=

       Just finished 2.5 /last section in chapter 2/ and I decide not to start in chapter 3, instead
       I will review chapter 2 and note on it. and start in chapter 3 after exams, yeah I will start
       Medician exams on $04-05$ and end on $16-6$.  may be i will take slowly chapter 3 but it is
       not a goal or even in my plan.
     - =2019-03-28=

       I re-read my last log, and the second part is not true, HtC & 2004 MIT lectures is noting.
       Maybe 1998 lectures is the best, but I will not watch them.
     - =2018-04-07=

       I Notice that, Lectures make no-sense I think I will read book only,
       and HtC lecture are good to replace the SICP 2004 lecture
     - =2018-04-01=

       DATE: 04/01/18 TIME: 16:58:55

       I thinking in reading book and not watch video, book is rich more than
       videos. but I did not take a decision yet. and I think I will not take
       this decision

       Sun Mar 25 09:36:58 UTC 2018

       Decide I will take SICP course. To know more theory about CS

       last log in 2nd year in med school summer,i think i'm no longer interested
       in basic of it, so maybe gonna jump to memory and these stuff or just stop it.
       i recebtly did't watch any lecture.
     - =2019-04-18=

       I stoped this course 2 weeks ago or so, it's not cuz it bad. I was in a bad mood,
       I skipped Lec5 /which about the vision/ and I think when I will back, I will start
       from memory.
